# openapi2jsonschema
Produce JSONSchemas from OpenAPI2 (Swagger) & OpenAPI3 definitions

## Features
* Supports **OpenAPI2** (Swagger) and **OpenAPI3** (with the `-v3` flag)
* Creates a JSONSchema for each model within the provided spec, and writes each to its own file
* Optionally generates an importable GoLang package containing constants for each JSONSchema (in case you want to have access to the JSONSchemas from code without having to deal with loading files)

## Install / build / testing
* Install in your go bin dir: `make install`
* Build in ./bin: `make build`
* Run all unit tests: `make test`
* Generate samples in ./out: `make samples`
